  From February until the end of June 2024, I worked on developing an Augmented Reality (AR) experience designed for the JCK in Amsterdam.
  The goal of the project was to create a new take on the previously made Eden’s and the Golden Rule VR installation. This ‘Golden Rule’ is as follows:
  <br></br>
      “In everything, do to others what you would have them do to you.”
      Gospel of Matthew (7:12)
