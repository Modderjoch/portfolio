  In January of 2023 I went abroad to Birmingham, where I studied a minor in Video Game Digital Art. The final project that period had to be a prototype of a game, solo-developed or in a team.
  The game can be found on itch.io. It is a mere proof of concept and because of that, there are still things missing and parts left unpolished.
  <br/>
  I have worked on this game for around 6 weeks. Mainly focussing on the programming side of things this time around.
  <br/>
  It all started with a very basic game concept, I wanted to combine the card game and city builder genres. This would be done in Unity, making use of local turn-based gameplay where the players could play cards and throw a dice to activate said cards.
  <br/>
  The gameplay would be based around earning money through activating your cards/buildings which would then lead to more money etc.
