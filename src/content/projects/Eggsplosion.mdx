      From April until June 2022 I worked on a unique local multiplayer game where you play as chickens and have to be the last chicken standing. 
      This was done in a <b>multi-disciplinary</b> team of seven, in which I was both a <b>game designer</b> and <b>project lead</b>. Together with two other designers, three artists and one 
      programmer we created Eggsplosion.

      Eggsplosion is a twin-stick arena brawler, meaning the preferred input is a controller, and during gameplay you run around collecting power-ups in a set arena.
      The goal is to remain until the end while surviving all other players. There are environmental dangers and plenty of obstacles to hide behind.

  <Header>Concept & responsibilities</Header>
  <Text>
    As a designer during this project I was responsible for the gameplay design, level design and finally UI implementation. 
    Together with my fellow designers we decided upon the following game principles:
  </Text>
  <List ordered items={["Fast paced", "Short and snappy rounds", "Chaos by design", "Humour is a feature"]}></List>
  <Text>
    Each of the designers built one of the arenas, the first one being my design. This was the only map with an environmental danger, after time
    the pig sat in the middle would activate a red nuke button. After which there would be multiple rockets dropping down all over the map.
    <br/>
    This helped pacing the games and created a lot of chaos under players when they had to focus on more than each other.

  <Header>Design approach</Header>
  <Text>
    We went for a fun-first approach through quick iterations and early playtesting. With a wide range of power-ups and solid level design we tried to
    invoke chaos and make it a game during which you can hear laughing at all times. The results was more than positive, players enjoyed the loop and were curious
    to see how they could do better next time. Even better, there were many laughs and a lot of fun was had during every playtest.

<Text>
  A big part of the gameplay design for Eggsplosion revolved around the power-ups placed around the map. These generally belonged to a few broader categories
  that we came up during our design sessions.
  <br/>
  Eventually we decided against some of them, and chose others to work out. Meanwhile the developer in the team started implementing a framework for them.

<Header>Move to Steam</Header>
<Text>
  Towards the end of the spring and the beginning of summer in 2023, I encouraged the team to pick everything back up and move towards publishing the game on Steam.
  This was eventually done on September 1st, 2023. During the move I mostly implemented extra UI to comply with the Steam Deck rules, as well as making it generally easier
  playing with different controllers. We implemented Steam Remote Play which helped us move it from just a local multiplayer to a networked one without much effort.
  <br/>
  On the publishing side of things I attempted to do some marketing and took care of everything on Steam's side of things, something that has taught me quite a lot
  and was great fun to do as well. Now the game is playable on one of the biggest platforms, and has been (positively) reviewed by fourteen people.
